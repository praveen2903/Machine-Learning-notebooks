When you add $n + 1$ th variable, the model will try to minimise the error by assigning it a valid coefficient. If it fails to do so, i.e. if the new variable isn't helping at all, it will simply assign it a coefficient of 0. Hence, $R^2$ will never decrease. \n",

Best way to do it is look at the change for a unit change.
